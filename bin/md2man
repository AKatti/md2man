# MD2MAN 1 "2012-02-02" "1.1.0"

## NAME

md2man - convert markdown(7) into roff(7)

## SYNOPSIS

`md2man` [*OPTION*]... [*FILE*]

## DESCRIPTION

[md2man] converts markdown(7) input from the given *FILE* into roff(7) using
[Redcarpet] and then prints the result to the standard output stream.  If
*FILE* is not given, then the standard input stream is read in its place.

### Document format

The following additional semantics are applied to the markdown(7) input:

  * There can be at most one top-level heading (H1).  It is emitted as `.TH`
    in the roff(7) output, specifying the UNIX man page's header and footer.

  * Paragraphs whose lines are all uniformly indented by two spaces are
    considered to be "indented paragraphs".  They are unindented accordingly
    before emission as `.IP` in the roff(7) output.

  * Paragraphs whose subsequent lines (all except the first) are uniformly
    indented by two spaces are considered to be a "tagged paragraphs".  They
    are unindented accordingly before emission as `.TP` in the roff(7) output.

### Markdown extensions

The following [Redcarpet] extensions for markdown(7) are enabled:

* tables
* autolink
* superscript
* strikethrough
* no_intra_emphasis
* fenced_code_blocks
